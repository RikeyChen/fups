# For User Progress (FUPS)

FUPS (For User Progress) is a self-help/social media application where users can monitor the mistakes they make in life and get data for improvement.

# Background and Overview

The idea originated from a users need to track daily mistakes in order to improve their life. FUPS will allow users to post their daily mistakes and view others (anonymously), which will create an environment that accepts fumbles and also offer entertainment/comfort from other people's mistakes.

The app will have user auth which will only need an email and password for user privacy. Each user will have a private profile page/dashboard where they will be able to post their daily mistakes or experiences. We will then use Google’s text sentiment analysis API (Cloud Natural Language) to track the posts and categorize them.

On the user dashboard, we will display data about the areas of life that we identify you mess up most, as well as constructive feedback. The data displayed here will be over time and should hopefully show an improvement trajectory.

For example: “Got yelled at this morning for cutting someone off in traffic” would prompt feedback like “Driving can be hard. Here are some resources for improvement! <span>www.</span><span>linktodrivingresources</span>.com”

The site will also have a newsfeed page where posts are completely anonymous but can be upvoted for support from fellow improvers.

# Technologies and Technical Challenges

#### Backend: MongoDB/Express
#### Frontend: React/Node.js
#### Google Cloud Natural Language
#### Let Me Google That For You (TEMP until we find a better API) (BONUS)

FUPS uses the MERN stack and the Google Cloud Natural Language API to to identify key words in sentences which we will identify as being problem words. Those words will then be logged in a table in the database and we will have an associated counter for every time the same word is used. We will have associations to find repetitive connections between the keywords used in the same post and we will pass those keywords into LMGTFY (or something similar) which will give the user the Google results they need.
